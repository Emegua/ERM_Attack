Claim 2: System-level degradation in Simulink

Paper Reference: Section 7.1  
Description:  
Running the MATLAB Simulink model `artifact/Simulink/PV_MPPT_DesktopSim.slx` reproduces system-level solar inverter degradation under ERM-triggered attacks.  
Expected Behavior:  
  - Observe DC bus voltage collapse and reduced AC output efficiency.
