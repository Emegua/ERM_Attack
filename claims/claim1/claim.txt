Claim 1: Circuit-level inverter disruption in LTspice

Paper Reference: Section 6.3.1  
Description:  
Running the LTspice XVII model `artifact/LTspice/DC-AC.asc` reproduces the circuit-level inverter disruptions caused by the ERM-triggered Trojan.  
Expected Behavior:  
  - Observe voltage degradation and waveform distortion after Trojan activation.
