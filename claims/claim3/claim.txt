Claim 3: Grid-level cascading instability in ETAP

Paper Reference: Section 7.3  
Description:  
Running the ETAP project `artifact/ETAP/ieee_13/ieee_13.OTI` reproduces cascading instabilities in the IEEE 13-bus system triggered by a compromised 100 kW inverter.  
Expected Behavior:  
  - Voltage instability and synchronization failures leading to blackout scenarios.
