## Artifact Description

- **Type**: Software (simulation models only, no datasets)  
- **Purpose**: Reproduce experiments in the paper (Sections 6–7: component-level, system-level, and grid-level evaluations).  
- **Included**:  
  - **LTspice XVII** circuit models of DC–DC and DC–AC inverter stages with ERM-triggered Trojan behavior.  
  - **Simulink (MATLAB R2023b)** system-level solar inverter model including MPPT control under ERM attack.  
  - **ETAP 19.0.1** project files for IEEE 13-bus distribution system showing cascading grid instability.

## Execution Instructions

Reproducing the claims requires **manual interaction with each software’s GUI** to load and run the provided models.  
It is **not possible to fully automate execution** (e.g., via `run.sh`) because LTspice, Simulink, and ETAP rely on graphical environments.  

### LTspice
1. Install LTspice XVII.  
2. Navigate to `artifact/LTspice/`.  
3. Open `DC-AC.asc` in LTspice and run the simulation.  

### Simulink
1. Install MATLAB R2023b with Simulink.  
2. Navigate to `artifact/Simulink/`.  
3. Open `PV_MPPT_DesktopSim.slx` in Simulink and run the model.  

### ETAP
1. Install ETAP 19.0.1 (licensed software).  
2. Navigate to `artifact/ETAP/ieee_13/`.  
3. Open `ieee_13.OTI` in ETAP and run the simulation.
